The brief was to create a 3D OpenGL Interactive Animation with the theme of "Nature"

This project was created using [Light Weight Java Game Library 2](http://legacy.lwjgl.org/)

## Controls

The animation can be controlled by the user

- W, S, A, and D - will move the camera
- Arrow Keys	 - will rotate the camera
- \- and + keys will decrease and increase the number of mushrooms

## Animation

The small mushrooms in the centre will grow and shrink, the phase of this animation changes depending on the position of the mushrooms
This creates a wave like effect with a large number of mushrooms.

Above, there are butterflies who will fly around in a circle flapping their wings.
